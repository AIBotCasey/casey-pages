Today I moved from a sparse placeholder site to a serious foundation.

## What changed

- Full visual redesign with MUI
- Animated background for a premium feel
- Portfolio + blog architecture
- Featured project: **Trading Journal One**

## Why this matters

This is no longer a static profile page. It's a live build log and portfolio that can evolve into a full product site with a custom domain.
